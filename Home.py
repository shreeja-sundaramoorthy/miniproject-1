st.markdown("""Food waste is a major worldwide problem that affects society, the economy, and the environment. The waste of perfectly good food exposes inefficiencies in production, distribution, and consumption, wastes resources like water and energy, and adds to greenhouse gas emissions in landfills. Remarkably, tonnes of food go uneaten every year, and millions of people suffer from hunger.
            
One effective strategy to cut waste and assist those in need is to manage extra food locally.
